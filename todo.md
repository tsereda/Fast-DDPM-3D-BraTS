✅ What's Completed:

2D Fast-DDPM Base: Fully functional 2D implementation that works with BraTS data
3D Model Architecture: Core 3D components have been created:

models/diffusion_3d.py - 3D version of the diffusion model
functions/denoising_3d.py - 3D denoising functions
Complete conversion guide in CHANGESFOR3D.md


Unified 4→4 Dataset: data/brain_3d_unified.py implements the unified approach for any-to-any modality synthesis
Testing Infrastructure: test_3d_model.py for validating 3D model functionality

🚧 In Progress:

Training Script Integration: The 3D components exist but aren't fully integrated into the training pipeline
Memory Optimization: 3D volumes require significant memory - current configs use reduced sizes (64³)
Unified 4→4 Training: Dataset supports it, but the training logic needs completion

❌ Not Yet Implemented:


Full BraTS Integration: The current setup uses simplified data loading

Future Directions, don't worry about for now: 

Performance Validation: No benchmarks against the proposed targets (SSIM > 0.91, Dice > 0.85)
Wavelet Integration: Mentioned in literature review but no implementation found
Bayesian Optimization: For timestep selection - not implemented
